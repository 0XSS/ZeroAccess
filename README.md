## Toolkit for ZeroAccess/Sirefef v3

ZeroAccess is an advanced malware family (probably most advanced from all of available), whose first appearance was in the middle of 2009. Initially Win32 kernel mode rootkit, transformed then into user mode toolkit. Uses self made p2p engine for communication (main purpose - download files). Based on modular structure. Survived multiple takedown attempts (they were mostly serving marketing purposes of various so-called security companies/corporations). Has multiple generations of various toolkit modules.

This project provide you insights into ZeroAccess v3 code and provide several instruments to work with ZeroAccess v3 files.
